# Learning Plan

## Overview
This folder contains a structured learning plan covering Python and JavaScript fundamentals, intermediate and advanced concepts, and specialized topics for data science, machine learning, and full-stack development.

## Folder Structure
- **Month 1-Foundations**: Review basic Python and JavaScript concepts.
  - **Week 1-2-Refresh Python Basics**: Review basic Python syntax, data types, control structures, and functions.
  - **Week 3-4-JavaScript Fundamentals**: Review basic JavaScript syntax, data types, functions, and control structures. Practice DOM manipulation and event handling.

- **Month 2-Intermediate Concepts**: Dive deeper into object-oriented programming and asynchronous programming.
  - **Week 1-2-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Dive deeper into OOP concepts in Python and JavaScript. Learn about classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
  - **Week 3-4-Asynchronous Programming and Frameworks**: Explore asynchronous programming concepts in JavaScript (callbacks, promises, async/await). Start learning about popular JavaScript frameworks/libraries (React, Angular, Vue.js). Build a simple web application using one of the frameworks.

- **Month 3-Advanced Topics**: Study advanced Python and JavaScript concepts.
  - **Week 1-2-Advanced Python Concepts**: Study advanced Python topics like generators, decorators, context managers, etc. Implement these concepts in practical projects or coding exercises.
  - **Week 3-4-Advanced JavaScript Concepts**: Dive deeper into advanced JavaScript topics like closures, prototypes, ES6 features, etc. Practice functional programming concepts (higher-order functions, map/filter/reduce). Work on more complex projects using JavaScript.

- **Month 4-Specializations and Projects**: Focus on data science, machine learning, and full-stack development.
  - **Week 1-2-Data Science and Machine Learning (Python)**: Learn about data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib. Explore machine learning concepts using scikit-learn or TensorFlow. Work on a small data science project or Kaggle competition.
  - **Week 3-4-Full-Stack Development (JavaScript)**: Dive deeper into your chosen JavaScript framework (React, Angular, Vue.js). Build a full-stack web application using Node.js for the backend and your chosen frontend framework. Focus on integrating backend/frontend components and handling HTTP requests.

- **Month 5-6-Special Projects and Refinement**: Work on advanced web development projects and portfolio building.
  - **Week 1-2-Advanced Web Development (JavaScript)**: Learn about browser APIs, web sockets, and modern web development tools. Refactor and optimize your previous full-stack project. Explore additional JavaScript libraries or tools (e.g., Express.js for backend).
  - **Week 3-4-Final Projects and Portfolio Building**: Work on one or two larger projects that showcase your skills in both Python and JavaScript. Polish your projects, add documentation, and deploy them to showcase your work. Create a portfolio website to showcase your projects and skills.
